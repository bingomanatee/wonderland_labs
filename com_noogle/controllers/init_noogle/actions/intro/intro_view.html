    <h3>Some useful terms</h3>

    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
        <div class="span2"><b>Domain</b></div>
        <div class="span10">At some point the archiving moved from one site's responsibility to another.
            Therefore the files are hosted at different domains. Regardless of the domain's identity,
            the archives are all of a single CHANNEL: <tt>irc.freenode.net#node.js</tt>.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
        <div class="span2"><b>File</b></div>
        <div class="span10">Each day of chat is archived in a single file. These files contain thousands of LINES of
            communication.
            The file name is also the date that the archive was taken. there should only be one file for each date
            (across all domains). (In fact, not only is there no overlap, there is a significant gap in the archive.)
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
        <div class="span2"><b>Line</b></div>
        <div class="span10">Each response by a single user is a <b>line</b> of communication, AKA a <b>Message</b>.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
        <div class="span2"><b>Username</b></div>
        <div class="span10">The username for each message is generated on logon. Unlike Facebook or other secure sites
            where each
            person is given a username and you can't log on as someone else, and its a pain to get your username
            authenticated, in IRC there are very little barriers to signing in with multiple usernames. It is up to
            the SERVER and CHANNEL to determine if usernames are required, and it is often difficult to switch machines
            -- i.e., if I log into IRC as bingomanatee at work and go home wihtout logging off, I often can't chat as
            bingomanatee
            from home, so I log in as dingomanatee and party on, til I can get back to work and log on/off as
            dingomanatee again.

        <div class="span2"><b>
            TL;DR</b>
        </div>
        <div class="span10"> Users in this channel often have / maintain multiple usernames, including joke
            usernames, and its not guaranteed that one person isn't "imitating" another user by using their
            username. (but please, don't.)
