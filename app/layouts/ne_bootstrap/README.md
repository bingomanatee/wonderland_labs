This layout is a nuby-express layout that implements the Twitter bootstrap library for nuby-express.

The version of the jquery ui libraries that is bundled here has been extremely stripped down -
components that exist in bootstrap (button, tabs, progressbar) have been removed.

the CSS library (smoothness) is included for completeness but its interactions with bootstrap have not
been analyzed at all so it is not included by default.
