* **[[hive_loader]](hive-loader)** reads and digests the content of a series of folders and files based on their naming conventions. 
* **[[hive_config]($1-config)** is a variation of the configuration module, designed to accept input as either a JS object or a JSON file path with basic get/set property methods. 
* **[[hive_menu]](hive-menu)** is a utility class for creating nested groups of links in a menu structure. 
* **[[hive_queen]](hive-queen)** is an idepodent scaffolding tool for creating hive websites based on a JSON configuration file. 
* **[[hive_model]](hive-model)** is a memory model class, suitable for basic unit test/mocking or for resource management. 
* **[[hive_model_mongoose]](hive-model-mongoose)** is a hive-model API compliant overlay for mongoose.
